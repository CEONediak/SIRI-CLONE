It helped me to go from the Macro - to the Micro -


I.start first with setting up your files properly, what you name them,
  where you require(‘requiredFile’) the info from, what variables you’ ll need, etc.

II.then think about‘ how’ to make requests
for the API--it’ s not an ajax call, its different
for each site you are accessing.The info
for HOW to do that
for
each site is in the npm documentation(links in the HW) or in that video ^ ^ ^ ^

III.then think about HOW you parse the info you get.
I used string.split() a LOT!!!!IT is crucial
for getting info from the JSON files

IV.Think about
if statements or
switch cases, the scope of variables and how you will feed them into functions
for EACH
case .And
finally how you will console.log them.It’ s just onsole.log.
Luckily we don’ t have to make a web page!!

good luck!
